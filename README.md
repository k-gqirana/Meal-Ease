### Web Scrapping 

  #### What is Web Scrapping?
        Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. It involves writing code to visit web pages,           parse the HTML or XML structure of those pages, and extract relevant data for further analysis or use.
        Here's a step-by-step explanation of how web scraping typically works:

        1. Identify the target website: Determine the website from which you want to extract data. It can be any website that allows                public access to its content.

        2. Choose a scraping tool or library: There are various tools and libraries available in different programming languages to                  facilitate web scraping, such as Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium.

        3. Understand the website's structure: Analyze the target website's structure, including its HTML or XML code. This involves                identifying the elements (tags, classes, IDs, etc.) that contain the desired data.

        4. Write the scraping code: Using the chosen scraping tool or library, write code to navigate to the target website's pages, send            HTTP requests, and retrieve the HTML content.

        5. Parse the HTML content: Once you have the HTML content, use the scraping tool or library to parse the HTML and extract the                relevant data. This typically involves searching for specific elements or patterns using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

        6 .Extract the desired data: Extract the desired data from the parsed HTML content. This could include text, images, links,                  tables, or any other information you're interested in collecting.

        7 .Store or process the extracted data: Depending on your requirements, you can store the extracted data in a file, a database,              or process it further for analysis, visualization, or integration with other systems.

  #### Web Scrapping examples: 
        Refer to the following example to scrape your first website using Javascript and Puppeteer [freeCodeCamp -Web Scrapping]       (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-scraping-in-javascript-with-puppeteer/amp/).
